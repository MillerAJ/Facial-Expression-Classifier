# Facial-Expression-Classifier
Written in python, this project utilizes scikit-learn and tensorflow to build, train and test convolutional neural networks to recognize human emotions in images of faces.

32 convolutional layers feeding into a 25-layer artificial neural network. The most accuracte model, cnn_model_3c2, had 1,747,756 trainabe variables. With the assitance of data augmentation, it achieved an accuracy of 83% on the test data. 

Classification report for cnn_model_3c2:
